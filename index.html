    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.  Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.

    <h3>what is programming</h3>

    <p>he three brothers Abū Jaʿfar, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (before 803 – February 873); Abū al-Qāsim, Aḥmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century) and Al-Ḥasan ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century), were Persian scholars who lived and worked in Baghdad. They are collectively known as the Banū Mūsā (Arabic: بنو موسی, "Sons of Mūsā (or Moses)").

        e Banū Mūsā were the sons of Mūsā ibn Shākir, who was a well-known Astronomer of al-Ma'mun, a son of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid. After their father's death, the brothers received an education under al-Ma'mun’s direction, and were enrolled at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. There they undertook the translation of ancient Greek works acquired from Byzantium, which they used to develop their own technological, mathematical and astronomical ideas. They were some of the earliest scholars to adopt Greek mathematics, but innovative in their approach to the concepts of area and circumference by expressing them using numerical values instead of ratios. They made geodesic measurements to determine the length of a degree of latitude, and so obtained a relatively accurate value for the circumference of the Earth.
        
        The Banū Mūsā wrote almost 20 books, all but three of which are now lost. The most important of all</p>

    <h4>Building the web of the future now</h4>
        <p>The Banu Musa were the three sons of Mūsā ibn Shākir, who earlier in life had been a highwayman and astronomer in Khorasan of unknown pedigree.[1] After befriending al-Ma'mun, who was then a governor of Khorasan and staying in Merv, Musa was employed as an astrologer and astronomer.[2]

            After Musa's death, the three orphaned children were cared for at the court of al-Maʾmūn, who made the senior Baghdad official Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Mus'abi their guardian.[3][4] Al-Ma’mun recognized their abilities, and enrolled them in the House of Wisdom, an institution created by him as a centre for collecting, translating and studying books from other lands.[5][6] In Baghdad, where they apparently lived for the rest of their lives, the three brothers studied geometry, mechanics, music, mathematics and astronomy, trained by a senior court astrologer, Yaḥyā bin Abī Manṣūr.[2][7]
            
            The three brothers, Moḥammad, Aḥmad, and Ḥasan, are often listed in what is assumed to be their order of seniority.[8][note 1]
            
            Accomplishments under the Abbasid Caliphate
            The Banū Mūsā assisted al-Ma'mun's in his obsession to obtain and translate works from Greek into Arabic. They sent for Greek texts from the Byzantines, or travelled themselves to Byzantium to acquire them.[9] During their working lives they used their wealth and energy towards the translation of these works.[8] On his way home to Baghdad from Byzantium, Muhammad met and recruited Thābit ibn Qurra,[9] a money changer from Harran. Thābit went on to make important discoveries in algebra, geometry, and astronomy.[2][10]
            
            Under the direction of al-Ma'mun, the Banū Mūsā worked with the most talented men available, including al-Khwarizmi, al-Kindi, Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar, and the mathematician and translator Hunayn ibn Isha</p>
